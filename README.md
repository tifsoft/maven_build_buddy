# Maven Build Buddy

Maven Build Buddy is a GUI for Maven.

It simplifies access to some Maven features - particularly partial and incremental builds.

Maven Build Buddy is designed to help those who are interested in optimizing their build time. The more complex and time-consuming your build process is, the more you will benefit from using it.

The tool offers a Maven build progress indicator, and a visual indicator of build status. This shows which modules have had their tests run - how many warnings were generated on each module - and so on.

Maven Build Buddy is currently under construction. There's still quite a list of things to do:
